# Producto-Consumidor

<p>
Program to represent the producer-consumer problem. 
</p>

<p>
The producer and the consumer share a buffer of finite size and while the producer generates products, the consumer takes products. The producer must generate products when the buffer has space to store products and the consumer can't try to take products when the buffer is empty.
